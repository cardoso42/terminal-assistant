## üé® Code Formatting

The project uses clang-format for consistent code formatting. Formatting is automatically applied to staged files when you commit changes.

### Manual Formatting

You can format all source files using CMake's format target:

```bash
cd build
make format
```

### Formatting Rules

The formatting rules are defined in `.clang-format` in the project root. The rules are based on the LLVM style with some customizations.
